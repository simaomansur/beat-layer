# Beat-Layer

## Overview
Beat Layer is a dynamic online platform designed for musicians and artists seeking collaborative synergy. By allowing users to contribute their unique 'layers' to existing beats, the app facilitates a musical dialogue where each addition enriches the original track. This virtual studio space not only fosters creativity but also archives the evolution of a beat as it transforms with each new contribution. It's a place where the solitary act of music creation becomes a communal journey, resulting in a tapestry of sounds that reflects the collective genius of its contributors.

In its current form, the app stands as an innovative platform for music sharing, a digital space where melodies intertwine and rhythms find their audience. But this is just the beginning. Envision a future where the app transcends its initial boundaries, evolving into an extraordinary realm of musical creation.

Imagine the introduction of a groundbreaking beat layering functionality, a feature that promises to revolutionize the way music is crafted and experienced. This will not be just an update; it's a metamorphosis, elevating the app from a mere sharing platform to an artistic forge, where users don't just share music â€“ they create it.

In this future, users will weave intricate tapestries of sound, layering beats upon beats, crafting unique musical experiences that blur the lines between creator and listener. Each user becomes a maestro, orchestrating symphonies of their own design, in a collaborative and immersive environment that pushes the boundaries of digital music creation.

This is more than an app; it's a new horizon in the music industry, a frontier where technology meets art, where every note holds the promise of innovation, and every beat echoes the heartbeat of creativity. The journey ahead is charged with potential, a symphony waiting to be written in the universal language of music.

## Development Process 

This section should be used to describe how the scrum methodology was used in this project. As a suggestion, include the following table to summarize how the sprints occurred during the development of this project.

|Sprint#|Goals|Start|End|Done|Observations|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|US#1, US#2|11/24/23|11/30/23|US#1, US#2|No troubles so far making progress but it seems that many stories might not get finished in the short time available|
|2|US#3, US#4, US#5|12/1/23|12/4/23|US#3, US#4, US#5|Steady progress is still being made. We had to throw out some features to get the project done on time but everything is working so far.|

## Testing

### black-box testing
1. Index Page:

  - Check for any unexpected behavior or errors during navigation.

### white-box testing

In order to do white-box testing, we used the coverage package. This package generates a report that shows the percentage of code that was executed during the tests. The report is generated by running the following commands:

```
coverage run unittests.py
```

```
coverage report
```

## Deployment

# Parker - 11/20/23 
## before running the app:
    export SECRET_KEY="pikachu" (mac) / $env:SECRET_KEY="pikachu" (windows)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    hweaclfuatojowlh (google app pw) (in practice we wouldnt put this in the code but for now its fine)

## what I did today:
- setup the template pretty much as before, except with a slightly different file structure (source code files are all in 'src' for organization)
    ** this makes python do some weird stuff -- we can play around with this if it ends up not being the move, but if importing, you might need to do absolute imports -> 'from src.app import models' (***instead of 'from from app import models').

Setup a basic template for the file structure - Beat (one to many ->) Layer (one to many ->) Stem
- index, base, signin, signup, beats (.html)
- models.py
- forms.py
- routes.py
Setup sign in / sign up / sign out routes
initialized Alembic (handy python package that helps with db migrations)
Some basic testing to make sure the routes were somewhat in working condition

# Simao - 11/24/23
## what I did today:
- changed the 'Beat' model but may be subject to more changes
- added 'beats' 'beats_new' and 'beat_detail' to routes.py
- added 'BeatForm' to forms.py
- added beats.html, beats_new.html, and beat_detail.html to templates
- created function to create new beats
- modified signin and signup slightly
- after sign in takes you to the beats page where you can create a new beat, this adds it to the beats page but no functionality past that yet
- basic testing and so far it looks good just need to add more functionality to the beats page

# Parker - 11/28/23
## testing notes:
- would be nice if the post signin flash was a bit more descriptive
    - adding a header and footer could make me feel less lost
- back to home should take you back to beats page, not to sign in page
- add profiles ?
    
## done:
- added new description under overview (below in readme)
- referenced user id's in created by fields users table (foreign key)
- changed date to datetime for specifity
- back to home goes to 'beats' instead of index
- added audio_file stuff 
    takes audio file from form
    saves it to src/app/uploads
    you can play the song from beat-detail page

# Simao - 11/29/23
- few chabges to beats page for better readability
- added ability to comment on the beats detials page
- did some overall testing and everything seems to be working fine (so far)

## notes:
- wanted to change the Beat model to add genres but didnt want to have to delete the database and start over
- this is something we should probably do in the future and work on together to figure out what we need to do

# Parker - 11/30/23
- lots of styling: menu bar, dark mode, UX stuff
- forgot password mostly implemented but still not updating the users password. it sends an email though ðŸ˜„
added genres drop down menu
- cleaned up some file structure stuff (got rid of sign in page. now it's 'home'. if you're already signed in, 'home' returns 'beats'.)

# Simao - 12/1/23
- added likes to beats
    - user can only like a beat once
- changed some layouts and added some styling
- made pages scrollable
- footer is now at the bottom of the page
- header is now fixed at the top of the page
- signup page style fix
- create new beat page style fix
- beats page style fix
    - still could use some work

# Simao - 12/4/23
- added search by genre functionality
- updated read me to feature information about the project

# Parker:
